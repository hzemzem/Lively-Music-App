# Lively Music App
The Lively Music App is a simple way to find music events you care about.

## Supported Search Types
Users can search by:
- Artist
- Venue
- Location

Each search can be further modified by providing a start and end date to limit results. For example, it is possible to search for "Beyonce at Philips Arena between June 30, 2017 and August 18, 2017".

## Map Based View
Where appropriate, results are shown using a map-based view, supported by Google Maps. In each case, a table of data will also be presented for accessibility.
